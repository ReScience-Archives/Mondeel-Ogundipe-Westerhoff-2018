## Replication of T. Shlomi, M.N. Cabili, E. Ruppin (2009) "Predicting metabolic biomarkers of human inborn errors of metabolism"

This is a repository with the code and article submitted to the [ReScience journal](rescience.github.io)

The reference for the original article:
T. Shlomi, M.N. Cabili, E. Ruppin, Predicting metabolic biomarkers of human inborn errors of metabolism, Mol. Syst. Biol. 5 (2009) 263. [doi:10.1038/msb.2009.22](http://doi.org/10.1038/msb.2009.22).


## Repository structure
The article folder contains the description of our replication of the simulations underlying Figures 1 and 2 of the original article and in addition a brief discussion on the sensitivity of the approach to changes of settings in the method. (see article/stojic2017.pdf).

The code folder is empty because we provide all our code in the notebook folder since nearly all relevant code is made available in Jupyter notebooks.

## How to run the simulations yourself?

The code has been developed on a Mac operating system in Python 3.6. To execute the code on your own computer you will need to install the following Python modules:
COBRApy, NumPy, SciPy, XlsxWriter, tqdm, lxml and xlrd.

Alternatively, use the MyBinder service, through the button at the top of this ReadMe file, to open an ananymous, personal cloud environment where all software is automatically installed and you will be able to run through all the notebooks there.
